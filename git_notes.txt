Github is a hub of git/ directories

You can push and pull commits to and from .git/ directories

you can also clone .git/ directories to new computers or new paths

master branch is a label that git creates for us when we initialize a repository
Head is another label that git creates for us when we create our first commit
Head is not a branch
#creates a new branch (label) called git-notes
git branch git-notes
#shows us which branch is active
git branch
